# Facial-Landmark-Detection

This paper uses a dataset of labelled sample images, labels come in the form of sixty-eight points (IBUG68) each represented by two separate values: x and y coordinates. Points are grouped in an ascending order depending on the area of the face they map. This is a supervised learning system where the labelled image data is fed into the neural network which will then predict sixty-eight landmarks per image throughout a test set. 


Using metrics such as Euclidean Distance and mean squared error (mse) we can compare different CNN structures and their effects on performance during training.
